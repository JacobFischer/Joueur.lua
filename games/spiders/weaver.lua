--- A Spiderling that can alter existing Webs by weaving to add or remove silk from the Webs, thus altering its strength.

-- initializes a Weaver with basic logic as provided by the Creer code generator
function Weaver:init(...)

    --- The Web that this Weaver is strengthening. Null if not strengthening.
    self.strengtheningWeb = nil
    --- The Web that this Weaver is weakening. Null if not weakening.
    self.weakeningWeb = nil

    --- (inherited) When empty string this Spiderling is not busy, and can act. Otherwise a string representing what it is busy with, e.g. 'Moving', 'Attacking'.
    -- @field[string] self.busy
    -- @see Spiderling.busy

    --- (inherited) How much damage this Spiderling does to the BroodMother.
    -- @field[number] self.damage
    -- @see Spiderling.damage

    --- (inherited) String representing the top level Class that this game object is an instance of. Used for reflection to create new instances on clients, but exposed for convenience should AIs want this data.
    -- @field[string] self.gameObjectName
    -- @see GameObject.gameObjectName

    --- (inherited) A unique id for each instance of a GameObject or a sub class. Used for client and server communication. Should never change value after being set.
    -- @field[string] self.id
    -- @see GameObject.id

    --- (inherited) If this Spider is dead and has been removed from the game.
    -- @field[bool] self.isDead
    -- @see Spider.isDead

    --- (inherited) Any strings logged will be stored here. Intended for debugging.
    -- @field[{string, ...}] self.logs
    -- @see GameObject.logs

    --- (inherited) The Web this Spiderling is using to move. Null if it is not moving.
    -- @field[Web] self.movingOnWeb
    -- @see Spiderling.movingOnWeb

    --- (inherited) The Nest this Spiderling is moving to. Null if it is not moving.
    -- @field[Nest] self.movingToNest
    -- @see Spiderling.movingToNest

    --- (inherited) The Nest that this Spider is currently on. Null when moving on a Web.
    -- @field[Nest] self.nest
    -- @see Spider.nest

    --- (inherited) The Player that owns this Spider, and can command it.
    -- @field[Player] self.owner
    -- @see Spider.owner

    --- (inherited) How much distance this Spiderling covers per turn when moving across Webs.
    -- @field[number] self.speed
    -- @see Spiderling.speed

    --- (inherited) The number of turns remaining for this Spiderling's current task.
    -- @field[number] self.turnsRemaining
    -- @see Spiderling.turnsRemaining

    --- (inherited) How heavy this spider is. Webs it moves across must have enough strength to support it in addition to existing Spiderlings.
    -- @field[number] self.weight
    -- @see Spiderling.weight

-- @function Weaver:log
-- @see GameObject:log
-- @tparam string message A string to add to this GameObject's log. Intended for debugging.

--- (inherited) Starts moving the Spiderling across a Web to another Nest.
