--- A Spider in the game. The most basic unit.
-- @classmod Spider
local Spider = class(GameObject)

-- initializes a Spider with basic logic as provided by the Creer code generator
function Spider:init(...)
    GameObject.init(self, ...)

    -- The following values should get overridden when delta states are merged, but we set them here as a reference for you to see what variables this class has.

    --- If this Spider is dead and has been removed from the game.
    self.isDead = false
    --- The Nest that this Spider is currently on. Null when moving on a Web.
    self.nest = nil
    --- The Player that owns this Spider, and can command it.
    self.owner = nil

    --- (inherited) String representing the top level Class that this game object is an instance of. Used for reflection to create new instances on clients, but exposed for convenience should AIs want this data.
    -- @field[string] self.gameObjectName
    -- @see GameObject.gameObjectName

    --- (inherited) A unique id for each instance of a GameObject or a sub class. Used for client and server communication. Should never change value after being set.
    -- @field[string] self.id
    -- @see GameObject.id

    --- (inherited) Any strings logged will be stored here. Intended for debugging.
    -- @field[{string, ...}] self.logs
    -- @see GameObject.logs


end

--- (inherited) Adds a message to this GameObject's logs. Intended for your own debugging purposes, as strings stored here are saved in the gamelog.
-- @function Spider:log
-- @see GameObject:log
-- @tparam string message A string to add to this GameObject's log. Intended for debugging.
